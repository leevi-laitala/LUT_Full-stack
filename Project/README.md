# Full-stack project

Simple board-styled "social media" site.

Three collections in databases:
- Users
- Posts
- Comments

Users collection would hold user information, such as username and password. Posts collection would host information on posts, like date of creation, title, body and likes/dislikes. Comments collection would share most attributes with regular posts, but are missing title and have identifier linking them to a parent post.
